== Getting started ==
This code is intended for the UCSB Robotics Lab Create + Kinect robot platform (or similar).  

It is recommended that you install the full ROS Diamondback stack as instructed [http://www.ros.org/wiki/diamondback/Installation/Ubuntu here] for Ubuntu.  
{{{
sudo apt-get install ros-diamondback-desktop-full
}}}

In addition you will need the joystick-drivers stack
{{{
sudo apt-get install ros-diamondback-joystick-drivers
}}}

And the Kinect drivers
{{{
sudo apt-get install ros-diamondback-openni-kinect
}}}
The ROS [http://www.ros.org/wiki/kinect Kinect page] is an excellent starting point and the [http://www.ros.org/wiki/openni_camera OpenNI camera page] is a.  

To run this package locally ensure that the Create and Kinect are connected and in a prompt run
{{{
roslaunch openni_camera openni_node.launch
}}}

In a second prompt run:
{{{
roscd create_kinect
roslaunch ./launch/firstTest.launch
}}}

== Launch files ==
 * *firstTest.launch* - Launch a basic bump bot first test with the Kinect mounted on the Create
