== Getting started ==

Make sure you have all of the required Kinect packages installed for ROS.  The ROS [http://www.ros.org/wiki/kinect Kinect page] is an excellent resource.  

Next if you have not done so already checkout the ucsb-ros-pkg repository as instructed on the main page and build the create_kinect project:
{{{
roscd create_kinect
rosmake
}}}
To run the basic test open up two command prompts and in the first run:
{{{
roslaunch kinect_camera kinect_with_tf.launch
}}}

In the second prompt run:
{{{
roscd create_kinect
roslaunch ./launch/firstTest.launch
}}}
