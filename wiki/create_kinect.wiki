== Description ==

This first test implements a simple bump bot where the Create drives forward while avoiding obstacles.  Much more to come from this project.

== Getting started ==
This code is intended for the UCSB Robotics Lab Create + Kinect robot platform (or similar).  It is recommended that you install the full ROS Diamondback stack as instructed [http://www.ros.org/wiki/diamondback/Installation/Ubuntu here] for Ubuntu.
{{{
sudo apt-get install ros-diamondback-desktop-full
}}}
In addition you will need the joystick-drivers stack
{{{
sudo apt-get install ros-diamondback-joystick-drivers
}}}
And the OpenNI Kinect drivers
{{{
sudo apt-get install ros-diamondback-openni-kinect
}}}
The ROS [http://www.ros.org/wiki/kinect Kinect page] is an excellent starting point and the [http://www.ros.org/wiki/openni_camera OpenNI camera page] explains a lot of useful features.  To install the iRobot Create drivers run the following commands
{{{
cd ~
svn co https://code.ros.org/svn/ros-pkg/branches/trunk_cturtle/stacks/create_robot/ create_robot
export ROS_PACKAGE_PATH=:~/create_robot:$ROS_PACKAGE_PATH
}}}
To run this package locally ensure that the Create and Kinect are connected and in a prompt run
{{{
roslaunch openni_camera openni_node.launch
}}}
You should see a print statement that says the OpenNI driver is connect to 1 device.  After that the Kinect drivers are running run
{{{
roscd create_kinect
roslaunch ./launch/firstTest.launch
}}}

Now on a separate machine on the same network set the ROS_MASTER_URI environment variable accordingly (see [http://www.ros.org/wiki/ROS/Tutorials/MultipleMachines this] for additional details) 
{{{
roscd create_kinect
roslaunch ./launch/remoteMonitor.launch
}}}
The remote monitor is used for switching between autonomous and manual mode as well as stopping the robot when needed.
